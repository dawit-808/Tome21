# Authentication API

Base URL:

```text
http://localhost:5000/api/auth
```

Authentication uses **Google OAuth 2.0** with Passport.js and server-side sessions.

---

## 1. Login with Google

### `GET /api/auth/google`

Starts the Google OAuth login process.

The user should open this endpoint in a browser. They will be redirected to Google to authenticate.

### Request

```http
GET /api/auth/google
```

### Response

Redirects the user to Google's authentication page.

After successful authentication, Google redirects to:

```text
GET /api/auth/google/callback
```

---

## 2. Google OAuth Callback

### `GET /api/auth/google/callback`

Handles the response from Google after authentication.

The backend:

1. Receives the Google profile.
2. Searches for the user using `google_id`.
3. Creates the user if they don't exist.
4. Updates the user's information if they already exist.
5. Creates the login session.
6. Makes the authenticated user available through `req.user`.

### Successful Response

```json
{
  "message": "Login successful",
  "user": {
    "id": "2",
    "google_id": "104595567437904654509",
    "name": "Dawit Tesfaye",
    "email": "tesfayedawit22090582@gmail.com",
    "image_url": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/...",
    "created_at": "2026-10-06T11:14:37.984Z",
    "updated_at": "2026-10-06T11:14:37.984Z"
  }
}
```

The user's session is also created automatically.

---

## 3. Get Current User

### `GET /api/auth/me`

Returns the currently authenticated user.

### Request

```http
GET /api/auth/me
```

The request must contain a valid authentication session.

### Success Response

```json
{
  "user": {
    "id": "2",
    "google_id": "104595567437904654509",
    "name": "Dawit Tesfaye",
    "email": "tesfayedawit22090582@gmail.com",
    "image_url": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/...",
    "created_at": "2026-10-06T11:14:37.984Z",
    "updated_at": "2026-10-06T11:14:37.984Z"
  }
}
```

### Unauthenticated Response

**Status:** `401 Unauthorized`

```json
{
  "error": "Not authenticated"
}
```

---

## 4. Logout

### `POST /api/auth/logout`

Logs the current user out and destroys their authentication session.

### Request

```http
POST /api/auth/logout
```

### Success Response

**Status:** `200 OK`

```json
{
  "message": "Logged out successfully"
}
```

---

## Authentication Behavior

After successful Google authentication, the backend stores the user's database ID in the session.

Protected routes use the authentication middleware:

```text
Google Login
     ↓
Passport
     ↓
users table
     ↓
Session
     ↓
req.user
     ↓
Protected API routes
```

The frontend does **not** send `user_id` when accessing user-specific resources.

For example:

```http
GET /api/cart
```

The backend determines the user from the authentication session.

---

## Protected Endpoints

The following endpoints require authentication:

```text
GET    /api/auth/me

GET    /api/cart
POST   /api/cart
PUT    /api/cart/:productId
DELETE /api/cart/:productId
DELETE /api/cart

POST   /api/orders
GET    /api/orders
GET    /api/orders/:id
```

Unauthenticated requests receive:

```json
{
  "error": "Authentication required"
}
```

with status:

```text
401 Unauthorized
```
